# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Detection-Using-ML
Abstract:
we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample![image](https://github.com/Anjanakp72/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Detection-Using-ML/assets/92908795/e02c8ba5-8ec7-485b-82ac-be1979297ab7)
